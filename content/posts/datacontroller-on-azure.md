## London, UK - July 27, 2020

Analytium Group today announced the availability of Data Controller for SASÂ® in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, an online store providing applications and services for use on Azure. Analytium Group customers can now take advantage of the productive and trusted Azure cloud platform, with streamlined deployment and management.

Data Controller for SAS is an enterprise data governance and data workflow solution, maintained by Analytium Group, specialists in analytics and data-driven app development. Data Controller for SAS is now available in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, an online store providing applications and services for use on Azure. Analytium Group customers can now take advantage of the productive and trusted Azure cloud platform, with streamlined deployments and management.

## Why Data Controller?

With data arriving from all directions in a fast-moving business environment, it's not always practical (or possible) to build automated, real-time processes for loading data into secure SAS environments. Data Controller for SAS enables business users in regulated cloud environments to self-serve their data uploads, and make safe and controlled updates to target tables with full data quality, approval step, and audit trail along the way.

Data Controller for SASÂ® has a web-based interface that allows nominated data owners to review all manual changes to data before they are applied, to maintain their data dictionary, and to set up data alerts and workflows. Other features include:

- Data Catalog
- Data Lineage
- Data Alerts
- DDL Export
- Data Quality Rules
- Excel / CSV Uploads

Data Controller leverages the access engines of SAS to provide native engine support, such as MS SQL Server, as well as regular SAS datasets and SAS Viya in-memory CAS Tables.
