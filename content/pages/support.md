# SAS App Support

SAS-Powered Web Apps - be they from SAS/IntrNet, SAS Stored Processes, Viya Jobs, or [SASjs Server Stored Programs](https://server.sasjs.io/storedprograms/) - are generally very stable.  That said, there are many reasons why an app can suddenly stop working, such as:

* Environment issues - authentication, permissions, server outages
* Data issues - missing files, model changes, encoding
* Code issues - for instance, saving an STP with Enterprise Guide (which inserts unwanted macros)

To provide you with maximum uptime for your business critical SAS Web Apps, we provide a support service as detailed below.

Pricing details are [here](/pricing).

## Overview

Our support goal is to get you back up and running as soon as possible in the case of any incidents. In addition, we are on hand to assist with troubleshooting, debugging, strategic advice, and to answer any questions in relation to your SAS App(s) - be they from admins, users, or developers.

Support does not include training or development activities, nor can it be used to resolve issues that do not relate to SAS Apps (eg data quality, platform unavailability, hardware issues, acts of god and suchlike).

## Service Level Agreement

All tickets should be raised via the support desk at https://support.4gl.io with the corresponding severity level, eg as follows:

* Level 1 - App is non-functional and cannot be used
* Level 2 - Critical issue, however the app is still functional
* Level 3 - Important issue
* Level 4 - Minor Issue

The severity level will be initially assigned by the client, and is subject to the agreement of all parties.  Circumstances may change during the lifecycle of an issue, and hence the priority may change (again, subject to all party agreement).

The targets for measurement are the timings for Response Time and Resolution Time, per the table below.

| Severity Level | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 hours | 8 hours (1 BD)|
| 2 | 2 hours | 16 hours (2 BD)|
| 3 | 4 hours | 4 BD |
| 4 | 1 BD | 1-2 weeks |

Response Time means the number of hours between the logging of the Support Request, and the time that a technician begins active work on the Support Request.  The beginning of active work by the technician can be evidenced by either the logon for Remote Access, or the e-mail by 4GL Ltd support staff.

Resolution Time means the number of hours between the logging of the Support Request and the provision by 4GL Ltd of a fix, or satisfactory response.

All times are deemed to be elapsed during UK Business hours (8am to 5pm), and following the UK holiday schedule.

Severity Level 4 Support Requests will be investigated on a first in / first out basis, after all Level 1/2/3 Support Requests have been solved.

Should a Severity Level 1 or 2 Support Request fail to be cleared within the Resolution Time, all applicable resources within 4GL Ltd will be called upon to assist in the issue.

If an issue cannot be reproduced, then the Resolution Time will be suspended until such time as it happens again.  Meanwhile, the support team will be on alert for the re-occurrence, and to foresee the actions needed to reproduce.  On reproduction, the Resolution Time will start again at zero.

## Technical and User Support

During customer working hours, the customer support desk (or a nominated internal representative) will generally provide first line support to end users.  Where the customer cannot solve the issue internally, for whatever reason, then the 4GL Ltd support desk will be used, and a ticket ID generated.

Where 4GL Ltd is maintaining the app source code, then fixes will be pushed to the relevant repo, and any relevant updates to the documentation will be made.

We also provide priority advice and assistance with using the SASjs framework to customers on support plans.

## Escalation

If a ticket cannot be resolved within the agreed SLA conditions, escalation has to be started by the assigned support department.  Escalation will be made via video call between managers at both the client and 4GL Ltd.  The list of names to be informed will be listed in Appendix A.

Complaints on services should be directed to both the 4GL Ltd Engagement Manager and the client Application Owner.
