About 4GL Apps

Bowe IO Limited (4GL Apps) is a UK company with award-winning software products, solutions and services that enable businesses to capture, manage, and analyse data to improve their operations and execute strategies more effectively.

Bowe IO's turnover is currently below the statutory requirement for a public modern slavery statement. However, we feel that it is important to demonstrate our commitment towards ensuring that modern slavery does not take place within our organisation. This is our first published modern slavery statement.

Modern Slavery Statement
This statement (the Statement) is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act) on behalf of Bowe IO Ltd, which is incorporated in England and Wales (Reg. No 08777171).

Our commitment
Modern slavery and human trafficking are fundamental violations of human rights and abhorrent crimes. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and are committed to improving our practices to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking does not take place within Bowe IO's own business or in its direct and indirect supply chains.

Supply Chain
As an IT company, Concentra does not have an extensive range of local or international suppliers where modern slavery or human trafficking would generally be a material risk and none of our suppliers are key to our businessesâ€™ success.

Bowe IO Ltd relies on its suppliers to self-audit or monitor their supply chains. Bowe IO Ltd does not require written certifications from suppliers expressly confirming and verifying their compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws, but Bowe IO Ltd may terminate its relationship with individuals or organisations who work on its behalf if it suspects breaches of the Act or other relevant anti-slavery and human trafficking legislation or of this policy.

Human Resources
We ensure that Bowe IO Ltd's recruitment process is in line with UK Employment Laws and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. All new employees are made aware of this Statement during their Induction process.

Allan Bowe

Chief SAS App Officer, Bowe IO Limited
