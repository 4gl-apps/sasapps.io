# Corporate Social Responsibility Policy

We believe that commitment to the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR) not only makes good business sense but also complements our core business strategy and company values. 

Our CSR policy is based on the following principles:

* To minimise the impact and maximise the benefits our work has on the environment and people around us.
* To integrate our CSR considerations into our business decisions.
* To comply with (or exceed) applicable legislation, regulations and codes of practice.
* To review and continually strive to improve our CSR performance.

In developing our strategy and setting out our policy we aim to deliver gradual but continuous improvements in our performance every year. As a result, our approach evolves as we learn lessons along the way. 

Our policy we have divided it into four key areas:

## Community

_Connecting & educating SAS users around the world_

We proactively support SAS User Communities and we aim to make the SAS communities in which we operate better places. We encourage and empower our employees to get involved with their local SAS communities and use their skills and where possible the Companyâ€™s resources to help create a mutual benefit.

## People

_Finding, supporting and developing great people throughout their 4GL journey_

We strive to ensure all colleagues enjoy their work and have opportunities to consistently amaze our customers through their friendly expertise. As such, we continue to invest in development programmes and actively look for ways in which we can promote and increase the diversity of our workforce.

## Environmental Management

_Managing our impact on the environment in a responsible and ethical manner_

ALL work has some impact on the environment and we have a duty to manage that impact in a responsible and ethical manner. We do this through identifying all significant environmental impacts and putting processes into place to prevent, reduce and mitigate them. This also makes good business sense.

## Responsible Trading

_Building and maintaining the highest standards amongst our partners and suppliers_

We are committed to maintaining high standards amongst our partners and suppliers. We oppose the exploitation of workers and we will not tolerate forced labour, or labour which involves physical, verbal or psychological harassment, or intimidation of any kind. We will [not accept human trafficking](/slavery-statement/) or the exploitation of children and young people in our business and undertake all reasonable and practical steps to ensure that these standards are maintained.
