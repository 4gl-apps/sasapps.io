# SAS AF/SCL Developer (remote)

4GL Apps are market leaders when it comes to SAS Application Development - we've been in business for 10 years, and are the creators of:

- [SASjs](https://github.com/sasjs) (DevOps framework for SAS)
- [Data Controller](https://datacontroller.io) (commercial data entry solution for SAS)
- [SASensei](https://sasensei.com) (SAS quiz game with over 5000 players)

Along with Stored Process Web App migration to Viya, creation of new SAS Apps, and support for existing SAS Apps, we also specialise in the modernisation of legacy SAS AF/SCL applications.

Due to increased demand for our services, we are now expanding the team.

It's a contract role, so we don't really offer any perks or benefits, just a great hourly rate, flexible (fully remote) working hours, and professional work environment.

We're looking for someone with the following MUST-HAVES:

- Project Management experience
- 10+ years of SAS experience
- 5+ years of SCL experience
- CET/GMT/EST timezone
- Impeccable English
- Delivery mindset

No JS skills needed - you will typically be focused on data management and the creation of the backend services (Base SAS, macros) that deliver the data to the frontend. A basic understanding of web technologies would definitely be helpful, as would an affinity with GIT, bash, and CI/CD pipelines.


To help us filter through the applicants who actually read the job description, we do have a small entrance test - please take the following steps:

- Register an account with [sasensei.com](https://sasensei.com)
- Unlock Green Belt
- Submit ONE question on the AF/SCL topic

When you submit your CV ([here](https://odoo.4gl.io/jobs/apply/1)), please also mention the username you registered with.
