You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

        	Recommended Gatsby CLI version: 2.12.61

2.  **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

    Next, move into your new site's directory and start it up:

    ```shell
    cd my-blazing-fast-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Create build and run locally `production` mode.**

    ```sh
    gatsby build
    gatsby serve
    ```

4.  **Push production build to server.**
    ```sh
    scp -P 18765 -r ./public/. analytiu@uk72.siteground.eu:/home/analytiu/public_html/sasappsio
    ```
