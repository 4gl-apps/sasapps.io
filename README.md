### Tech

SASApps uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Gatsby] - framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps
- [Netlify] - an excellent option for deploying Gatsby sites.
- [Netlify CMS] - an open source, single page app written in React that lets you edit content and data files in your Git repository.
- [Kwes Forms] - Most customizable form service for web agencies.

Netlify auto-deployments and Netlify CMS is configured with Self Hosted Instance of Gitlab. So, just make commit to master branch and push to gitlab.
